<h1>About</h1>
<body>
 <p>My name is Adelegan Saheed. I am from Owo, Ondo State, and I graduated from the University of Ilorin with a degree in Arabic Education. With a passion for teaching, I have dedicated my career to educating students in the Arabic language and culture.<br><br>

    In addition to my teaching expertise, I am a skilled web developer, combining technology with education to create engaging and interactive learning experiences. My love for Arabic literature and poetry has deeply enriched my teaching, allowing me to share the beauty and depth of the Arabic language with my students.<br><br>
    
    I am married to a beautiful and blessed girl, and her support has been instrumental in my professional journey. Through my diverse skill set and dedication, I strive to inspire and empower my students to achieve fluency in Arabic, appreciate its rich literary heritage, and succeed in their academic and personal endeavors.
